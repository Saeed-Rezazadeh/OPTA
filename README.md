The OPTA values are obtained using the complete JSCC theorem in [1, Theorem 3] (by calculating the
sum of the users distortions) which readily applies for the case of correlated Gaussian
sources sent over the discrete memoryless binary additive two-way channel (BA-TWC) with additive noise. 
However for binary multiplying two-way channel (BM-TWC)
since there is no complete JSCC theorem for the discrete memoryless BM-
TWC (as the exact determination of its capacity region is still an open problem even
in the absence of additive noise), we include an upper bound on the system's OPTA
using the converse result in [2, Lemma 2].
